## Josh Tatterton

I'm a maths grad and newly established programmer, currently looking to use and develop the recently acquired development skill I gained in my time as part of Makers Academy's second Ronin cohort. 

## Skills

#### Code Writing

I have worked using test driven development while pair programming projects with git version control. Mainly using mainly Ruby and Javascript for a mixture of front-end and back-end development. In building websites I have gained skills in HTML, CSS styling then deploying my applications to Heroku for hosting.

###### Ruby

- I have written Ruby logic for a variety of different situations.
- Using Sinatra and Ruby on Rails to build web application frameworks.
- Became proficient with Rspec and Capybara for test driving Ruby code development.
- I have used PostgreSQL databases to store and request data as needed and used external sources such as Amazon Web Services for hosting images.

###### Javascript

- Used generic Javascript as well as some of its sub-languages such as jQuery, node and Angular.
- Again test driven the creation of these aspects using jasmine then karma and protractor.

###### Coding Examples

- A solo project I worked on in Sinatra is a website to play [battleships online](https://gentle-journey-9691.herokuapp.com), where you can play against other people online. I used postgres for maintaining player state with databases and sessions. I also wrote the Ruby logic for the game of battleships that gets played. Using jQuery I control the flow of player games, only allowing players to fire when it was their turn by making API request to my own server. [See the code](https://github.com/JoshuaTatterton/BattleshipsWeb)

- In our final Ronin cohort project we developed an [online showcase for charities to advertise their development needs](https://fathomless-plateau-2837.herokuapp.com) alongside our client, AgileVentures. We used a Ruby on Rails app and database logic for persisting information while also storing images remotely on Amazon servers to save space. See the website [See the code](https://github.com/JoshuaTatterton/AgileVenturesWebsiteTwo) 

- I created a simple single page [To Do application](https://ancient-escarpment-2552.herokuapp.com) using angular and node as the server to keeping track of jobs to be done. Angular allowed for the dynamic changing of the page without refreshing the app and was test driven with Karma and Protractor. [See the code](https://github.com/JoshuaTatterton/todo_challenge)

## Education

#### Makers Academy (July to October 2015)

- A very compact 12 week full time course with 4 week precourse.
- The Ronin course aspect allowed for remote pair programming with people across the country and America.
- Learned to program using the agile programming process alongside object-oriented programming, test and behaviour driven design.
- Gained the ability to problem solve, improve and learn new languages quickly and efficiently after having to learn and implement new languages after only a week after using them. 

#### Northumbria University (September 2010 to July 2013)

- Mathematics Bsc Hons (2:2)
- My enjoyment of the Computational Mathematics I did during my degree led me to attending to Makers Academy.
- I also completed a cryptology module for using and decrypting cyphers, several modelling modules working in a group to apply maths to more real world situations. I also completed multiple modules in financial, statistical, pure and physics based mathematics.

#### Ossett School 6th Form and College (September 2003 to July 2010)

- Please see full list of qualifications [here](https://github.com/JoshuaTatterton/CV/blob/master/qualifications.md).
