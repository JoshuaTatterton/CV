## Josh Tatterton

I'm a maths grad and newly established programmer, currently looking to use and develop the recently acquired development skill I gained in my time at Makers Academy. 

A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment.

## Skills

#### Code Developer

I have worked using TDD and BDD while pair programming projects using mainly ruby, Javascript and html for a mixture of front-end and back-end programming. Personally I prefer working on the back-end and making an application functional rather than making it pretty. 
Please see the following projects 

- The [Final Project](https://github.com/JoshuaTatterton/AgileVenturesWebsiteTwo) of my time at Makers Academy, working with a client  to create a website to showcase completed and charities it problems and solutions. See the app [here](https://fathomless-plateau-2837.herokuapp.com)
- My [Lab Week Project](https://github.com/JoshuaTatterton/BattleshipsWeb), this solo project to create a website to play an online game of battleships against another person. See the app [here](https://gentle-journey-9691.herokuapp.com)
